 * /corrections — deterministic correction mining over this project's session
 * transcripts. Finds commands that failed and were re-run in a fixed form
 * (e.g. `python` failing, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` working), folds them
 * into rules, and on `apply` writes them into a marker-delimited block in
 * the project AGENTS.md so the next session runs the right command first.
 * Dry-run by default; no model calls.
