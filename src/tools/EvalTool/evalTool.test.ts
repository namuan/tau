/**
 * Eval tool invariants.
 *
 * Run via: bun run src/tools/EvalTool/evalTool.test.ts
 *
 * Three groups:
 *   1. CACHE — the tool schema must be byte-stable across turns. These are the
 *      tests that matter most; a failure here silently doubles token cost for
 *      every session by breaking the ~50-70K cached prefix on every request.
 *   2. PURE — formatting, clamping, allowlists.
 *   3. LIVE — a real Python kernel, skipped when no interpreter is present.
