/**
 * Authoritative MCP startup readiness.
 *
 * The launch barrier has to answer one question: is startup MCP discovery
 * settled? AppState cannot answer it. A source that is still enumerating has
 * registered no clients yet, so an empty `mcp.clients` is indistinguishable
 * from "no servers configured" — a check for pending clients alone can
 * release the wait before asynchronous config discovery has finished.
 *
 * So readiness is tracked here, in a React-independent registry that the hook,
 * print mode and main.tsx all report into, in two parts:
 *
 * - **Sources** (local config and dynamic/SDK config): each
 *   is registered as enumerating *before* its fetch starts and settles when it
 *   has finished handing over the servers it found. Registration of a source's
 *   servers and completion of that source are one transition (`settleSource`).
 * - **Servers**: each eligible server settles when its tool discovery has
 *   finished or it reached a terminal state (failed, needs-auth, disabled).
 *
 * Settled means every registered source has settled and every server they
 * registered has settled. Ineligible sources (bare mode, strict config,
 * enterprise policy, disabled by settings) settle immediately.
