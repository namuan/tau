/**
 * Validate MCP tool arguments against the server's own input schema.
 *
 * An MCP tool carries a JSON Schema from its server. Tau's `MCPTool` stands in
 * for all of them with `z.object({}).passthrough()`, which accepts anything —
 * so until now the only MCP call that was ever checked against a real schema
 * was a blind deferred one. Every other MCP call was dispatched with whatever
 * the model sent, and a mistake surfaced only as whatever the server did with
 * it. This validates them all.
 *
 * Two things the previous blind-call validator got wrong, both reproduced:
 *
 * - It cached compiled validators by tool name. A server that changed a
 *   parameter's type kept the old validator under the same name, so the new
 *   contract's valid arguments were rejected and the old contract's invalid
 *   ones accepted. Validators are keyed by a hash of the schema itself here,
 *   so a changed contract is simply a different key.
 *
 * - It rejected any property the schema's `properties` map did not name, even
 *   when the schema said `additionalProperties: true` — a schema that is open
 *   by design, whose valid extra fields it turned away. A schema that says so
 *   explicitly is now taken at its word. The extra-property rule survives only
 *   for a blind call against a schema that does not say, where an unnamed
 *   property is more likely an invention than a deliberate extra and is worth
 *   a correction round-trip rather than a silent dispatch.
