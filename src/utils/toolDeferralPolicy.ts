 *
 * Client-side discovery rewrites the tool array mid-session: every ToolSearch
 * load appends schemas to the front of the request. On these providers the
 * tool block sits inside the cached prefix, so one load voids the whole
 * conversation cache and the next N turns re-send it uncached -- then the
 * following load does it again. Measured on real sessions: 79-87% of all
 * uncached input on deepseek/mimo/fireworks was re-sent prefix, not new
 * content, with the collapses landing within three turns of a ToolSearch
 * call (mimo 75%, fireworks 50%, deepseek 44%).
 *
 * Two shapes qualify, and neither gives Tau a breakpoint to re-anchor on:
 *   - automatic/implicit prefix caching (deepseek, mimo, and alibaba, whose
 *     Model Studio implicit cache is always on and cannot be disabled)
 *   - a session-pinned `prompt_cache_key` reusing one backend's KV cache
 *     (fireworks, moonshot, cloudflare, mistral, lxd)
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here:
 *   - openrouter / opencode / opencodego — always eager, independently of this set.
 *   - vercel / requesty / copilot / iflow — these pass
 *     `cache_control` through and place breakpoints themselves, so the lane
 *     re-warms on its own terms.
 *   - minimax, glm, groq, nim — no prefix-cache pin at all (minimax actively
 *     deletes `prompt_cache_key`), so deferral costs them nothing.
 *   - ollama / lmstudio — local, where the scarce resource is context window
 *     rather than a billed cache; schema savings are worth the re-prefill.
 *   - gemini — already excluded via isAntigravityModelId, whose comment
 *     describes this same failure mode.
