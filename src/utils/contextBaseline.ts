 * Size of the context a session already carries before it sends anything.
 *
 * The status line reports the last API call's usage, so until the first
 * response arrives it has nothing to report and shows zero — even though the
 * session is already holding its system prompt and tool definitions. On a real
 * project that is tens of thousands of tokens, so a fresh session reads as
 * `0/200K (0%)` when it is really closer to 30K.
 *
 * The measurement is async while the status line is built synchronously on
 * every render, so it is taken once in the background and read synchronously
 * from here.
 *
 * Nothing here is hardcoded: the number comes from the live session's own
 * prompt and tools, so it tracks the project it is in.
