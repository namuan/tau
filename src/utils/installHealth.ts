/**
 * Runtime read of the lifecycle-completion marker that `scripts/postinstall.mjs`
 * writes as its final mandatory step.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `npm install -g @namuan/tau` run directly honours the
 * user's npm config, so `ignore-scripts=true` — common in corporate and
 * security-hardened setups — silently skips postinstall. That install has no
 * vendored ripgrep and no native helpers, and until now nothing noticed:
 * `getLifecycleMarkerStatus` lived in the installer package and was read only by
 * the installer and its tests, never by the running app. postinstall.mjs already
 * says "a failed run means the missing marker makes the updater repair it on
 * next launch" — this is the missing half of that sentence.
 *
 * The installer (`@namuan/tau-installer`) forces
 * `--ignore-scripts=false --include=optional` plus npm's newer
 * `--allow-scripts` allowlist, so an install that went through it always has a
 * marker. A missing one therefore means the install bypassed the installer or
 * was interrupted, and the fix is to run it.
 *
 * Read-only and total: every failure path returns a value, so a malformed or
 * unreadable marker can never throw into a caller. Nothing here spawns a
 * process, touches the network, or writes.
