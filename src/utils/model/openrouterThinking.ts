/**
 * OpenRouter per-model thinking store.
 *
 * OpenRouter unifies every upstream's reasoning surface behind one request
 * field — `reasoning: { enabled, effort, max_tokens }` — but WHICH of those a
 * given model accepts, and which effort values it takes, is per model and is
 * published by OpenRouter itself (see openrouterReasoningCatalog.ts):
 *
 *   meta/muse-spark-1.3     Default / Minimal / Low / Medium / High / xHigh / Max
 *   x-ai/grok-4.20          Default / Off / Low / High / Max
 *   deepseek/deepseek-v3.2  Default / Off / On          (reasons, no ladder)
 *   openai/gpt-5.5-chat     (no chip — the row does not reason)
 *
 * So the ladder cannot be the fixed low/medium/high set Tau's own thinking
 * budget speaks. `["max","high","low"]` has no `medium` at all, and `minimal`,
 * `xhigh` and `max` were unreachable before this module existed. Every stop
 * below `default` comes straight out of OpenRouter's catalogue, in ascending
 * effort order, and nothing else is ever put on the wire.
 *
 * `Default` is a Tau-side stop meaning "no per-model override": the session's
 * own /thinking setting drives the row, mapped onto a value the model actually
 * published. It is where every row starts, so a model nobody has configured
 * behaves exactly as it did before — OpenRouter applies its own
 * `default_effort`.
 *
 * `Off` is only offered where OpenRouter says reasoning is optional. On a
 * `mandatory: true` row (the whole Muse Spark family) `enabled: false` is a
 * 400, so the stop is not offered and never sent.
 *
 * The pick persists to Tau config's openrouter-thinking.json keyed by model id.
