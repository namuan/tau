/**
 * Provider policy for spawned-agent tier aliases.
 *
 * Built-in and configured agents may ask for a tier (`haiku`, `sonnet`,
 * `opus`, ...), but a tier name is not itself a model that every provider can
 * serve. Resolve those automatic aliases from the active route, not from a
 * generic cross-provider fallback:
 *
 *  - direct OpenAI/Codex sessions on GPT-5 or later (GPT-5.6, GPT-6, ...)
 *    use GPT-5.6 Luna for every tier;
 *  - Antigravity uses its provider-specific Gemini Flash-low model;
 *  - OpenRouter uses the requested free Nemotron agent model;
 *  - every other provider inherits the exact live session model.
 *
 * Concrete model IDs and `inherit` are deliberately outside this policy. A
 * concrete ID is explicit caller intent, while `inherit` already has precise
 * runtime semantics in getAgentModel().
 *
 * This module is pure. Provider and parent model are supplied for every call,
 * so changing /provider or /model affects the very next spawn without a cache.

 * without being told the agent is pinned, and a tier says nothing about which

 * the provider's own fixed agent model. Both drop the pin, so the pin wins.
