/**
 * Alibaba Model Studio per-model thinking store.
 *
 * Qwen does not have one thinking knob, it has three, and which ones a model
 * accepts differs per row. Model Studio documents them as:
 *
 *   enable_thinking    boolean, hybrid thinking/non-thinking rows only
 *   reasoning_effort   one of the values THAT model publishes
 *   thinking_budget    a token cap — and explicitly not to be sent alongside
 *                      reasoning_effort
 *
 * So the ladder cannot be a fixed low/medium/high set. It is read per model
 * out of models.dev `reasoning_options` (see alibabaCatalog.ts) and rendered
 * as-is, which is what the API actually describes:
 *
 *   qwen3.8-max     Default / Off / Low / Medium / xHigh   (toggle + effort)
 *   qwen3.7-max     Default / Off / On                     (toggle only)
 *   glm-5.2         Default / None / Minimal / … / Max     (effort only)
 *   qwen3-max       (no chip — the row does not reason)
 *
 * `Default` is a Tau-side stop meaning "no per-model override": the session's
 * own thinking setting drives the row, through whichever fields it published.
 * It is where every row starts, and it is what makes `/thinking` reach this
 * provider at all — Model Studio turns thinking ON by default on the hybrid
 * rows, so a stop that sent nothing would quietly bill a thinking request to
 * someone who had turned thinking off. Express no preference at all and
 * nothing is sent, leaving the vendor default alone.
 *
 * Only fields the model published are ever sent: `enable_thinking` needs a
 * `toggle` option, `reasoning_effort` needs the value on that model's own
 * list. Model Studio answers 400 for a parameter a model does not take
 * ("parameter.enable_thinking only support …"), so silence is the only safe
 * default for a model the catalogue has not described.
 *
 * The pick persists to Tau config's alibaba-thinking.json keyed by model id.
