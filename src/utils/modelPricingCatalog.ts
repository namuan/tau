/**
 * Published per-token prices from models.dev, so third-party models can be
 * costed instead of counted as unpriced.
 *
 * MODEL_COSTS in modelCost.ts covers Claude and Gemini. Everything else was
 * unpriced, which is honest but reports $0 for real spending. models.dev is a
 * community-maintained catalogue (MIT, https://models.dev) whose entries are
 * keyed by provider and by the same model id the provider itself uses -
 * `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` is exactly the id a session runs - so a lookup
 * is an exact match rather than a guess.
 *
 * Kept dependency-light on purpose: fs/os/path only. modelCost.ts sits behind
 * a broken transitive import that stops it loading outside the bundler, and
 * pricing rules are worth testing.
 *
 * The same document states each model's context window per host, so the
 * table keeps those as well (lookupCatalogContextWindow). One download serves
 * both, under the same discipline.
 *
 * ── Discipline ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   - Lookups are synchronous and pure memory. Cost is computed per stream
 *     part; it can never wait on a network.
 *   - A failed refresh changes nothing. The table on disk stays, however old.
 *     Prices move over months, so a stale price is approximately right, while
 *     a missing one is only ever "unpriced" - never a wrong number.
 *   - A price is used only when BOTH the provider and the model id match.
 *     Guessing across providers would attribute one vendor's rate to another.
