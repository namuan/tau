/**
 * Release-channel resolution tests.
 *
 * Run via: bun run src/utils/releaseChannel.test.ts
 *
 * Background. `/config` used to offer a "stable" auto-update channel, and three
 * places turned that setting into an npm dist-tag with
 * `channel === 'stable' ? 'stable' : 'latest'`. No `stable` tag has ever been
 * published, so `npm view @namuan/tau@stable version` exits non-zero with
 * E404. getLatestVersion reports that as null, and every caller reads null as
 * "already up to date":
 *
 *   AutoUpdater.tsx           `... && latestVersion && ...` -> guard false, no update
 *   useNpmUpdateNotification  `if (!latestVersion) return null` -> no notice
 *   cli/update.ts             prints a network/proxy diagnosis, which is wrong
 *
 * So a user who picked that option stopped receiving updates and was not told.
 * These tests assert on source text because the resolvers are inline constants
 * with no seam to call, and the property that matters is that no code path asks
 * the registry for a tag that does not exist.
