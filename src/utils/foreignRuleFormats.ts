/**
 * Rule-file dialects written by other coding agents, read in place.
 *
 * Each tool spells "which files does this rule apply to" differently, and each
 * has its own answer for what an *unscoped* rule means. Getting that second
 * half wrong is the expensive mistake: tau's memory loader treats a rule with
 * no globs as unconditional and puts it in the cached system prompt, so a
 * dialect whose unscoped rules are meant to stay dormant would have every one
 * of them injected into every request forever.
 *
 * Cursor and Copilot both have dormant-by-default rules, so they are marked
 * `inert` and skipped rather than promoted. The model can still read those
 * files on request — they are ordinary files in the repo — they just are not
 * force-fed.
 *
 * Project-scoped only. The user-level locations these tools also support
 * (~/.cursor/rules, ~/.codeium/windsurf/memories, ...) are deliberately not
 * read: they are edited for a different tool's benefit, and letting them move
 * tau's cached prompt prefix would be both surprising and expensive.
